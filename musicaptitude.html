										<h2>Comparative Analysis of Music Aptitude and Academic Achievement</h2>
										<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/music-academic-aptitude-project-chrissy-sample-90llc/">LinkedIn Article <u>here</u></a>

										<p>My hypothesis was there would a significant percentage of 70% or more students passing both music and either math or reading.
											<br> 
										I was surprised this was only true for 26% of students who passed reading and music!</p>
									<p><img src="images/music/1stgradeanalysis4.jpg" class="responsive"></p>
									<p>37% of students passed math and music. A little more than compared to the reading assessment, 
										<br>but still not nearly what I had expected.</p>

									<p><img src="images/music/1stgradeanalysis5.jpg" class="responsive"></p>
									<p>The NWEA MAP tests also calculate growth from one test to the next. I expected 70% or more students to have high music 
										<br>achievement and significant growth (50% or greater). Only 53%-56% of students were in this category. </p>
									<p><img src="images/music/1stgradeanalysis6.jpg" class="responsive"></p>
									<p>Group D led the way in math and reading scores, but was 3rd in music. Group C led music, but was 3rd in math and reading. 
										<br>This for sure was not what we were expecting to see!</p>
									<p><img src="images/music/1stgradeanalysis7.jpg" class="responsive"></p>
									<p>While all classes achieved significant growth averages (50% or more), it is notable that Group C, who led the way for music scores, 
										<br>also had the lowest rating for math and reading growth.</p>
									<p><img src="images/music/1stgradeanalysis8a.jpg" class="responsive"></p>
									<p>3% of students are passing reading or math only, while not passing music - these are the outliers</p>
									<p><img src="images/music/1stgradeanalysis8b.jpg" class="responsive"></p>
									<p>In this scatter plot view, it is easier to see the quadrants of the categories, including the 4 students (6%) 
										<br>who did not pass either reading or music, and the 2 students (3%) who met the reading goal but not music.</p>
									<p><img src="images/music/1stgradeanalysis8c.jpg" class="responsive"></p>
									<p>In this scatter plot view, it is easier to see the quadrants of the categories, 
										<br>and how there are clearly more students who passed math and music (37%), compared to reading and music (26%).</p>
									<p><img src="images/music/1stgradeanalysis9.jpg" class="responsive"></p>
									<p>Following are screenshots of the dynamic dashboards created in PowerBI to analyze this project. 
										<br>Multiple spreadsheets were cleaned and merged with Power Query, where I then created calculated columns and measures to further analyze 
										<br>the information to answer the questions we had.</p>
