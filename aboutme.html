									<h3><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/delivery-performance-report-chrissy-sample-jttac/"><u>LinkedIn Article: Who Am I, Really?</u></a></h3>
									
									<p>✋ Hello! I am a Data Analyst of 2 years and a music Educator of 13 years. My professional journey began in the classroom and evolved into initiating and leading data analysis projects that support the growth and improvement 
										of instrumental music programs. With a background in web design, my proficiency in technology and the prevalence of data within education inspired me to further 
										specialize my career outside of the classroom. I am familiar with academic data and have expanded into business and financial reporting. I specialize in detailed work, 
										conducting thorough analysis and providing accurate reporting to achieve the goals within the organizations I work with.<br><br>

										😎 I have a unique blend of competitive administrative & project management skills that were born through working in education and bookkeeping where analytics and detail 
										are key for improvement and growth. <br>
										<br>
										🏆 Here are a few of my memorable accomplishments:<br>
										
										💥 Founder and co-founder of multiple instrumental music programs.<br>
										
										💥 Designed and managed multiple websites and social media platforms to advertise, market, and increase visibility of the programs I work with.<br>
										
										💥 Actualized a scholarship program that allowed increased participation for the instrumental music lesson program by 400% over 5 years. 
										Recruiting and collaborating with instructors was essential for this success.<br>
										
										💥 Streamlined monthly financial dashboard updates by automating the ETL process of statements utilizing Power Query.<br>
										
										💥 Conducted a comparative analysis of music aptitude and academic achievement using Excel and Power BI. This project was supposed to 
										highly suggest that music makes kids smarter, but I'm sad to report that it did not! (Results in an article below)<br>
										
										💥 Pioneered the growth of a new music program where I secured and allocated funding of over $13,000 for instrument and material 
										procurement to build the inventory necessary to serve over 400 students.<br><br>
										
										🎉What I look for in prospective employers:🎉<br>
										
										✔ Employers who care about the right fit, shared values, and who provide opportunities for career growth.<br>
										
										✔ Roles within a collaborative team where there are people of varying experiences able to support and learn from each other.<br><br>
										
										I am happy to connect with like-minded professionals!</p>
